# Blog Writing Process

This document defines the step-by-step workflow from raw input (usually a video transcript)
to a finished blog post draft. Follow these phases in order. Do not skip phases. Do not
start writing prose until Phase 3.

## Blog Home Directory

The blog home directory is set by the author at session start. All blog artifacts live there.

**Directory structure:**
- `_blog-skill/` — Skill-wide persistent storage (series trackers, learned preferences,
  cross-post memory). Survives across all posts and sessions.
  - `series-tracker.md` — Series state, episode numbers, callbacks, open threads
- Per-post working directories as organized by the author

**Per-post files** (research banks, drafts) go in the post's working directory. The
working directory is usually set by the author before starting.

**At the start of every blog session**, read `_blog-skill/series-tracker.md` (if it exists)
to know the current state of all series. At the end of every session where a post is
published or substantially completed, update it.

## Research Memory Bank

Maintain a structured notes file throughout the process. This serves two purposes: it's a
working document that keeps research organized across phases, and it persists across sessions
if the conversation is resumed later.

The slug is provided by the author at the start of the conversation (see Phase 0). Examples:
`deep-dive-ep4`, `never-trust-llm`, `intent-chain`.

**File:** `blog-research-[slug].md` in the current working directory.

Write to it at phase checkpoints and whenever significant new information arrives
(clarification answers, author feedback, editorial decisions).

**Structure:**
```markdown
# Research Memory Bank: [working title]
Created: [date]
Last updated: [date] — [phase]

## Source Material Summary
[Phase 0: key narrative beats, people involved, what was shown, failures, successes]

## Product Context
[Phase 0: relevant product features, verified claims from docs, CLI commands, terminology.
Skip this section if no product context is configured.]

## Clarification Log
[Phase 1: numbered Q&A — questions asked, answers received, all rounds]

## Editorial Plan
[Phase 2: main idea sentence, CTA, series context, approved structure outline]

## Voice Calibration
[Phase 2+: assignment mode, two or three representative passages and their authorship,
readiness, comparison notes, paragraph continuity result]

## Draft Notes
[Phase 3+: any decisions made during writing, author feedback, revision notes]
```

**Rules:**
- Update sections as new information arrives — don't just append, keep each section current.
- Before starting Phase 3, re-read the entire memory bank to confirm you have everything.
- The memory bank is a working document, not a deliverable. It doesn't need to be pretty.

---

## Phase 0: Intake

**First thing:** Ask the author for a short slug (kebab-case, 2-4 words) to identify this
post. Examples: `deep-dive-ep4`, `never-trust-llm`, `intent-chain`. Use this slug to name
the research memory bank and draft files. Do not proceed until you have the slug.

Then check for an existing `blog-research-[slug].md` in the working directory. If found,
read it and tell the author where you left off. If not found, create a new one.

**Input:** The author provides source material. This is usually a video transcript but could
also be meeting notes, a rough outline, a conference talk transcript, or a previous blog
post to extend.

**What to do:**

Read the entire source material. Build a mental model of the narrative. Identify:
- Who is involved (speakers, collaborators, quoted individuals)
- What was built or demonstrated
- What went wrong (there's almost always a failure story)
- What went right (the fix, the alternative approach, the insight)
- What was shown on screen that the transcript references but you can't see
- Jokes, asides, and cultural references that surfaced naturally

**Gather product context (if configured):** If a resolved identity declares a
`product-context` resource, list every product feature, command, or concept mentioned in
the source material. Consult it and fetch relevant authoritative pages directly. If a
feature is absent from available sources, flag it in Phase 1. A legacy
`persona/product.md` can still supply context but does not activate corporate identity.

**Fetch previous posts in the series:** If this post belongs to a series, use WebFetch to
read the previously published posts (URLs are in the personal identity's `examples`
resource). This ensures
continuity of callbacks, running jokes, character dynamics, and narrative arc. You have the
context budget for it — use it.

**Do NOT start writing. Do NOT summarize. Move to Phase 1.**

---

## Phase 1: Clarification

**Purpose:** Fill every gap in your understanding. The transcript is a lossy compression of
a video. Things that were obvious on screen are invisible in text. Things that were said
casually might be technically important.

**How to do it:**

Ask **one question at a time**. Each question presents 1-4 concrete options plus an open
answer escape hatch. Mark your best guess with an arrow or "← my guess". The author should
be able to answer with a single number in most cases.

**EVERY question MUST include your best guess as one of the options.** Do not ask open-ended
questions like "what happened here?" or "what was on screen?" Instead, reconstruct what you
think happened from context and present it as the likely option. The author should be able
to answer most questions with a single number. You do the heavy lifting.

**Example format:**

```
At ~12:30 you said "and then this happened." What was on screen at that point?

1. The agent's terminal output showing an error ← my guess
2. The IDE with the config file open
3. The browser showing the dashboard
4. Something else (describe briefly)
```

Wait for the answer, then proceed to the next question. Do not batch questions.

**Question grouping:** Group questions by type under section headers, in this order:
1. **Narrative gaps** (what happened when) — needed to structure the post
2. **Technical gaps** (exact commands, outputs, configurations) — needed for accuracy
3. **Visual gaps** (what was on screen) — needed for placeholders
4. **Context gaps** (references to other work, people, previous posts) — needed for callbacks

Present each group as a headed section (e.g., "### Narrative gaps") with its questions
underneath. This lets the author scan by category instead of reading a flat numbered list.

Keep asking questions one at a time until you can reconstruct the entire narrative without
uncertainty. Tell the author roughly how many questions you expect ("I have about 6 questions
to fill in the gaps") so they know what to expect, and update if the count changes.

**Checkpoint:** The author confirms the narrative reconstruction is accurate. No ambiguity
remains.

---

## Phase 2: Editorial Planning

**Purpose:** A transcript wanders. A blog post has a spine. Determine the one thing this
post is about, and everything else is either supporting evidence or cut material.

### 2a: Main Idea

Answer this in one sentence: "This post shows that [specific claim], demonstrated by
[specific evidence]."

If you can't fill that template, the post isn't focused enough. Propose a main idea and
confirm with the author.

### 2b: CTA

What should the reader do after reading this? Options typically include:
- Install/try a tool or library (with exact commands)
- Read the next post in a series
- Watch the video/stream
- Check out a specific repository or resource

If the author has product context configured, suggest a product-related CTA and confirm.
Otherwise, suggest a general CTA appropriate to the content.

### 2c: Series Context

If this is part of a series, read `_blog-skill/series-tracker.md` (in the Blog Home
Directory) for the full state: title patterns, previous episodes, established callbacks,
open threads, and teasers. Then confirm with the author:
- Which callbacks or running jokes should continue in this post?
- What's the teaser for the next installment?
- Any new recurring elements to establish?

### 2d: Structure Outline

Propose section headers and a 1-2 sentence description of each section's purpose. Confirm
with the author before proceeding.

**Placeholders go in the outline, not just the draft.** For each section, include the
specific placeholders that will appear there, using the standard format with independent
numbering per type:
- `[Screenshot 01: the Grafana panel showing memory usage]`
- `[Code 01: the rate limiter middleware config]`
- `[Link 01: OWASP rate limiting guide]`
- `[Diagram 01: request flow through the middleware stack]`

Screenshot, Code, Link, Fact, and Diagram each have their own counter starting at 01.
The outline is where placeholder planning happens — don't defer it to the draft.

**When to use a diagram vs. a screenshot.** A screenshot of the real system (terminal
output, UI state, a dashboard mid-incident) is almost always more honest than a diagram.
Use a diagram when the concept is structural — architecture, request flow, component
relationships, state transitions — and no single screen capture can show it. Don't
default to a diagram because it looks professional; default to the artifact that proves
the point with the least abstraction.

### 2e: Honest Limitations

If the post involves a product, tool, or approach, ask the author: "What can't this do?
Where does it fall short? What should the reader know before trying it?" Include at least
one limitation or caveat in the outline. Acknowledging what doesn't work builds more trust
than any amount of praise — it shows the author has real experience, not just marketing
talking points. The limitation doesn't need its own section; it can live inside the
technical meat or the broader point as a natural aside.

### 2f: Voice Calibration Plan

Name the assignment mode and apply `skills/blog-writer/references/voice-calibration.md`.
Select two or three contiguous passages from that mode, record their authorship, and note
what each demonstrates across the five calibration dimensions. Store the result in the
research memory bank.

If the identity has no usable matching prose, mark voice calibration unresolved. Ask the
author for evidence, then continue only with that state visible. Do not substitute an
approved manifest, a device list, isolated lines, or unread URLs for the missing passages.

### 2g: Structural Audit of the Outline

Before the checkpoint, audit the outline against `skills/blog-writer/references/structural-audits.md`. Run the
three outline-level audits **one at a time** — the study behind them found aspect-based
checking catches 95.4% of what it looks for against 68.4% for a single combined read.

Audit the outline, not prose you haven't written yet. Structure is nearly free to change
here and expensive to change in Phase 4.

**Audit 1 — Theme explicitness.** Walk the section list and mark every place the main idea
gets stated: the TLDR, the hook, each section close, the broader point, the CTA. More than
one is the tell. Cut down to one and decide which placement lands hardest. Patterns #29 and
#38 catch the sentence-level forms during the draft check; this is the document-level count.

**Audit 2 — Structural tidiness.** Ask whether every thread in the plan closes and whether
there is exactly one causal spine with no digression. If both are true, that is the tell.
The fix is at most one move: an oblique tangent, a question raised and openly unanswered, or
stopping before the resolution. A technical post still owes the reader the fix — the target
is the tidy epilogue after the fix landed, never the fix itself.

**Audit 6 — Shape convergence.** Name the planned opening mode, arc, and closing mode, then
ask `check-shape-convergence.sh` for the verdict. Do not read or compare the history
yourself. The invocation, the exit-code routing, and the correction loop are in SKILL.md
Step 9; the field meanings and both contracts are in `skills/blog-writer/references/post-shapes-schema.md`.

When an audit finds no issue, proceed silently. Report a `can_fire` of false, though — that
says the audit could not run, which is different from running clean. An audit that fires on
every post is miscalibrated, and applying all three at once builds the new cluster the
audits exist to prevent.

**Checkpoint:** Author approves the main idea, CTA, and structure outline.

---

## Phase 3: First Draft

**Purpose:** Write the post. Use the approved structure. Follow the tone guide religiously.

**If personal identity is selected, re-read its voice resource and selected calibration
passages now.** Do not rely on memory from earlier in the conversation. Name the assignment
mode and confirm whether the evidence gate is ready or unresolved. With corporate-only
writing, use the generic tone guide for expression and do not invent an individual persona.

### Writing rules:

1. **Start with the opening hook, NOT the TLDR.** Write the TLDR last.

2. **Write sections in narrative order.** The reader should feel like they're on a journey,
   not reading a report.

3. **Every section must earn its place.** If a section doesn't serve the main idea, the
   narrative arc, or an earned digression, cut it or fold it into another section. Keep a
   digression whose detour changes how the reader receives the next beat.

4. **Code blocks are part of the story.** Don't dump code without context. Set up why the
   reader is about to see this code, show it, then explain what it means.

5. **Sentence and paragraph craft.** Apply the rules from `skills/blog-writer/references/tone-guide.md` section
   "Sentence & Paragraph Craft" while writing — not just during review. Key checks:
   - One new competing idea per sentence. Related ideas may share a sentence when their
     relationship is the point. If you're cramming unrelated claims, split.
   - Generalize before listing unfamiliar items ("three tools: X, Y, Z").
   - Strong subjects (real actors) and strong verbs (real actions). Don't hide actions
     behind state verbs or nominalizations.
   - One developing topic per paragraph. Its first sentence opens, develops, or qualifies
     the current movement; it need not restate a miniature thesis.
   - Every paragraph must move the reader toward the main idea, carry necessary connective
     tissue, or earn a digression that changes the next beat.

6. **Maintain narrative density in EVERY section, not just the opening.** This is the most
   common quality failure. The opening hook always has personality because writers focus
   there. But by mid-post, the voice drifts toward report/analyst style. Watch for:
   - Passive summaries replacing specific moments ("Implementation proceeded" vs "I hit
     enter and the agent scaffolded 62 files in twelve seconds")
   - Missing human reactions (what did you say? what did your collaborator say? what did
     you feel?)
   - Abstract nouns replacing lived experience ("The architectural convergence" vs "Three
     companies shipped the same idea within a month")
   - Paragraphs that could be rewritten as bullet points without losing anything
   Re-read `skills/blog-writer/references/tone-guide.md` section "Narrative Density: Show, Don't Summarize"
   for the full diagnostic.

7. **Placeholders use INDEPENDENT numbering per type.** There is NO shared counter
   across types. Screenshots start at 01 and increment on their own. Code starts at
   01 and increments on its own. Same for Links, Facts, and Diagrams. WRONG: Screenshot
   01, Code 02, Screenshot 03. RIGHT: Screenshot 01, Code 01, Screenshot 02.
   ```
   [Screenshot 03: the agent re-ingesting 100 files]
   [Code 02: the config file after installing the plugin]
   [Diagram 01: request flow through the rate limiter middleware]
   ```
   The last number of each type = total assets of that type the author needs to prepare.

8. **Aim for 1,500-2,000 words.** 2,000 is a target, not a cliff. A tight 2,200 that
   earns every sentence is better than a padded 1,800. If you're under 1,200, you're
   probably not going deep enough on the technical content. Don't pad to hit a number
   and don't butcher good content to stay under one.

9. **Write the TLDR last.** ALWAYS bullets, 2-4 items. Never prose paragraphs. Each bullet is a standalone
   provocation — something that makes the reader think "wait, really?" The TLDR sells the
   journey, it doesn't summarize the destination.

10. **End with the author bio when one is configured.** Follow the personal identity's `bio` resource. The kicker
   must connect to something specific in THIS post. Propose a kicker and confirm with the
   author — don't reuse the same one across posts unless nothing better fits.

11. **The Comparison Trap.** Posts that involve before/after demos, A/B tests, or tool
    comparisons are magnets for patterns #1, #2, #5, and #6. The content naturally involves
    contrasts (old vs. new, broken vs. fixed, input vs. output), and every sentence about
    those contrasts will default to mirrored grammatical structure unless you actively fight
    it. When writing a comparison post:
    - Write the "before" story and the "after" story as separate narratives with different
      sentence structures, not as matched pairs
    - If you catch yourself writing "[thing A] does X, [thing B] does Y" in any form,
      rewrite so only one of them gets a full sentence and the other is folded into a
      different construction
    - The anti-pattern check for comparison posts should include an extra pass specifically
      looking for mirrored clause pairs, even if they don't match the exact examples in the
      anti-pattern file

### Placeholder conventions:

Each placeholder type has its own **independent** numbering sequence, zero-padded.
Counters are **separate per type** — there is NO shared counter. A post can have
Screenshot 10, Code 03, Link 05, Fact 02, and Diagram 03 all at the same time. The
last number of each type tells the author exactly how many of that asset they need
to prepare. WRONG: Screenshot 01, Code 02, Link 03, Screenshot 04. RIGHT: Screenshot
01, Code 01, Link 01, Screenshot 02.

- Screenshots: `[Screenshot 01: description]`, `[Screenshot 02: description]`, ...
- Code to verify: `[Code 01: description] <!-- VERIFY: reconstructed from transcript -->`
- Links to confirm: `[Link 01: description]`
- Facts to check: `[Fact 01: description]`
- Diagrams: `[Diagram 01: description]` followed by a fenced ```d2 block with the
  diagram source, then `<!-- VERIFY: diagram reconstructed from narrative context, confirm architecture -->`

**Example in a draft:** a post might contain, in order: Screenshot 01, Code 01, Screenshot
02, Diagram 01, Screenshot 03, Code 02, Link 01, Screenshot 04. That's 4 screenshots, 2
code blocks, 1 link, 1 diagram — each count is immediately obvious from the last number
in its sequence.

**Prioritize demonstrations over static illustrations.** A screenshot of the product in
action (terminal output mid-run, UI responding to input, a before/after diff) is worth
more than a polished hero image. A video or GIF of the workflow beats a screenshot. When
planning placeholders, prefer assets that show the product *doing something* — the reader
should be able to picture themselves using it. If the source material includes a live demo
moment, that's your strongest placeholder.

**Diagrams earn their place by clarifying complexity prose can't carry.** A diagram is the
right choice when the reader needs to see structure — how components connect, how a request
moves through a stack, how state changes — and the narrative would otherwise have to spell
out relationships the eye grasps instantly. A diagram is the wrong choice when it decorates
rather than clarifies, when a screenshot of the real system would do the same work, or when
the prose already makes the structure obvious. Integrate diagrams like any other asset: set
up what the reader is about to see, show it, then interpret what matters about it.

### Inserting and confirming placeholders:

The author's video transcript will reference things visible on screen that Claude cannot
see. After reconstructing the narrative:

1. Identify every moment where something was shown on screen, code was demonstrated, a link
   was referenced, a fact needs verification, or a concept would benefit from a diagram
   (architecture, flow, system relationships)
2. Insert placeholders using the numbering conventions above — independent sequences per
   type, no shared counter
3. For code placeholders, include best-guess content and flag it:
   `<!-- VERIFY: reconstructed from transcript, confirm actual code -->`
4. For CLI commands, reconstruct from context and flag if uncertain
5. For diagram placeholders, generate D2 source inline in a fenced `d2` block and flag it:
   `<!-- VERIFY: diagram reconstructed from narrative context, confirm architecture -->`

Before the draft is finalized, ask the author to confirm or replace every placeholder.
Cover all five types — Screenshot, Code, Link, Fact, Diagram — and treat the `VERIFY`
comments on reconstructed code and diagrams as open questions rather than resolved content.
The Phase 3 sweep runs with `--mode draft`, so these supported markers remain permitted
while the author is still reviewing the artifact.

### After writing:

Run the anti-pattern check (three passes). Open `skills/blog-writer/references/ai-anti-patterns.md` and scan
the draft:

**Pass 1 — Surface scan:** Read the draft against each pattern in the catalog, looking for
the forms described in the examples and structural variants.

Pass 1 is two different jobs, and running either one as if it were the other is how both
halves fail. Keep them apart.

#### The counting half — the script does this, not you

Some patterns have candidates detectable by an arithmetic result: word counts
per sentence, occurrences per section, character presence, runs and windows. Reading for
them does not work. Uniform sentence length is invisible when reading for content and
obvious when counting.

Run `sweep.py` over the draft through `skills/blog-writer/references/sweep-review.md`,
the shared invocation and exit-code contract for both routes. Counts establish matches;
its contextual disposition determines whether a stylistic match warrants a rewrite. Which patterns it covers, and with what
figures, is the script's own contract — the run reports them in `.coverage.ran`, and the
named constants under "Decision contract" at the top of `skills/blog-writer/sweep.py` hold
the numbers. Do not reproduce either here or by reading. The fix for each pattern it
reports is in `skills/blog-writer/references/ai-anti-patterns.md` under that pattern's number.
The same object carries `.observations.em_dashes`: paired-aside locations, per-section
counts, and spacing counts. Those figures are inputs to the #7/#8 identity and genre
judgment, never findings on their own.

Rerun it after each completed editing pass: a clean draft plus one edit is an unchecked draft, and the
most common way a tell ships is being introduced by the fix for something else.

**A clean sweep is not a clean draft.** The script reports its own coverage on every run,
including a run with no findings. It cannot speak for the patterns it did not examine, and
its silence about them is not a pass.

#### The judging half — no script does this, you do

For the patterns below the string match is the trivial part and the call is the work. Search
literally where a watchlist is named, then read every hit and decide. A hit is a candidate,
not a finding.

- **Contrastive negation (#1):** Do a literal, case-insensitive search for "rather than".
  Case matters: "Rather than X, Y" fronts the construction at the start of a sentence, and
  a case-sensitive search silently misses every one of them. Then judge each hit — it is
  pattern #1 only when the two sides are candidates for the same slot, with the negation
  doing the work of "not". The "Not X. Y." form announces itself on a contextual read; this
  one does not, which is why it needs the literal search first and the judgment second.
- **Manufactured rule of three (#3):** Judge whether each item adds supported content,
  including neutral triples without a kicker. Use the paired judgment fixtures in #3;
  retain enumerations of three distinct facts. The fragment sweep cannot judge padding.
- **Em-dash calibration (#7/#8):** Read `.observations.em_dashes`, then compare its paired
  asides, section counts, and spacing with the selected same-mode calibration passages.
  Judge the punctuation's rhetorical function and the assignment genre. A pair or a high count is a
  candidate, not a finding. Preserve an earned interruption or identity-backed density;
  report the judgment unresolved when usable calibration evidence is unavailable.
- **Announcement clauses (#28/#30):** `sweep.py` reports two enumerable shapes —
  a cataphoric clause handing over to a colon, and the catalog's fixed openers.
  The rest is this pass's work, and it is a sweep, not a read: take every clause
  that could be deleted without cutting a noun, a number or a name — coordinated
  clauses after `and`/`but`, clauses before a colon, sentence-initial adverbials
  — delete it, and re-read the span that follows. If that span is unchanged, the
  clause announced instead of saying, and it goes. Run this over clauses you
  wrote yourself in this session first: those are the ones you will otherwise
  read back as intent rather than as candidates.
- **Introductory filler words (#10):** Search for the watchlist words from the
  "introductory filler words" variant in pattern #10: "of course", "naturally", "obviously",
  "clearly", "certainly", "indeed", "in fact", "honestly", "frankly", "additionally",
  "furthermore", "moreover", "first of all", "that said", "that being said", "needless to
  say". For each hit, apply the delete test: remove the word and re-read the sentence. If
  the meaning is unchanged, delete. If it is not, the word is doing real grammatical work
  and stays. No script can run that test. These accumulate invisibly — one per paragraph is
  death by a thousand cuts.
- **AI vocabulary (#12):** Scan the canonical watchlist, including inflections of emphasize,
  enhance, highlight, and showcase. Apply the current-versus-historical weights and the
  usage qualifiers. One precise occurrence is not a finding. In a technical post the
  literal senses are ordinary English and stay; concentration and usage make the verdict.
- **Synonym cycling (#17):** Build a term inventory: list every noun phrase used for each
  core concept in the post. If any concept has more than one name, flag it. Cross-section
  cycling — one term in the intro, a different one in the conclusion — is the most common
  miss. Deciding that two phrases denote one concept is the whole check.
- **Stacked data points (#32):** Find every sentence or passage with two or more
  statistics. Count how many of those numbers describe the same change. If two or more data
  points make the same point (a raw number AND a percentage AND a time savings), keep the
  strongest one and cut the rest. Whether two numbers make one point is a reading, not a
  count.
- **Temporal filler (#35):** Scan for the watchlist phrases ("In today's", "Now more than
  ever", "In the age of", "In the current", "As [X] continues to evolve", "In an
  increasingly"). These hide in opening sentences and topic transitions. Apply the delete
  test: if the phrase can be deleted without changing the meaning, delete it. If the
  sentence collapses without it, the sentence had no content — replace it with a specific
  fact.
- **Corporate cliché phrases (#36):** Check whether any product or tool description uses
  composite corporate phrases ("end-to-end solution", "trusted by industry leaders",
  "passionate team", "drives business value"). Apply the interchangeability test: swap the
  product name for a competitor's. If the sentence still works, it is a cliché — replace it
  with a specific fact.
- **Vague relationship (#40):** Search the candidate inventory, including `connected to`.
  Apply the relationship test and name the role, cause, ownership, or function the evidence
  supports. Keep literal technical connections whose domain meaning is already precise.
- **Ceremonial coverage (#42):** Search for the named publication and source-quality
  candidates. Ask what claim the source evidence establishes. A named publication stays
  when the draft uses its reporting or measurement; flag it when appearing in coverage is
  doing the work of proof.

The remaining patterns in `skills/blog-writer/references/ai-anti-patterns.md` get the contextual read this
pass is named for. The script's silence is not a verdict on them, and neither is a clean
result on the checks above.

**Craft sweep (between Pass 1 and Pass 2):** Check the draft against `skills/blog-writer/references/tone-guide.md`
section "Sentence & Paragraph Craft":
- **Overloaded sentences:** Find any sentence that answers 3+ distinct questions (what? how?
  for whom? why?). Split it.
- **Cold lists:** Find enumerations of 3+ unfamiliar items introduced without a category
  label. Add a generalization ("three tools:", "two reasons:").
- **Weak subjects:** Find sentences where the subject is an abstract noun or nominalization
  ("the implementation of," "the presence of," "reforestation"). Check whether a real actor
  is hiding. If so, rewrite with the actor as subject.
- **Nested subordination:** Find sentences with 2+ subordinating conjunctions (which, that,
  because, when, although, if). If they're nested (one inside another), flatten by splitting.
- **Paragraph topics:** Read only the first sentence of each paragraph in sequence. Do they
  tell a coherent story? Flag any that are vague ("Let's consider another aspect...") or
  that don't connect to the preceding paragraph's conclusion.
- **Goal alignment:** For each paragraph, ask "does this advance the reader toward point B?"
  Preserve connective tissue and an earned digression that changes how the next beat lands.
  Flag a tangent that changes neither the argument nor the reader's relationship to it.

**Paraphrase test (craft sweep, before Pass 2):** take each load-bearing sentence alone
and restate it as a claim a reader could agree or disagree with. A restatement that needs
the writer's intent means the sentence carries none of its own — see pattern #43. This is
the check the author is least able to perform on their own prose, because re-reading
supplies the missing meaning for free, so run it deliberately rather than by impression.

**Pass 2 — Skeleton scan:** For each pair of adjacent sentences, strip the content and
look at the grammatical skeleton only. Ask: "Do these two sentences have the same shape?"
Subject-verb-object mirroring, parallel prepositional phrases, matching parenthetical
structures — any of these in adjacent sentences is a flag, regardless of whether it matches
a named pattern. Vary the structure of one sentence in the pair. Pass 2 catches patterns
that Pass 1 misses because the vocabulary is different but the grammar is identical.

**Pass 2 runs twice: once over adjacent sentence pairs, once inside every series.**
The second half is the one that gets skipped, because the first half feels like the
whole pass. Take each list, colon tail, or run of examples with two or more items;
strip the words and compare the item skeletons. Two of three items sharing a shape
is the finding — the odd item out is what makes the series read as cadence rather
than content. Report the series you checked; a Pass 2 reported as complete without
naming them is a Pass 2 half run.

**Pass 2 must also cover lists and example sequences**, not just adjacent sentence pairs.
When a paragraph contains 3+ examples, case studies, or items in a series, check whether
they share an identical grammatical skeleton across items. Full-sentence examples hiding
inside a dense paragraph are still a pattern if they all follow "[agent did X] — fix went
into [Y]" or any repeated skeleton. Sentence length does not excuse structural repetition.

**Thematic number trap:** When the post's content naturally involves a specific number
(e.g., three tiers, five stages), the LLM will lean into that number harder than a human
would — manufacturing neat "[N] things, [N] results" summaries that announce the pattern
instead of letting the examples show it. Be extra suspicious of numerical summaries that
echo the post's theme. If the content already demonstrates the count, the sentence
announcing it is manufactured symmetry.

**Pass 3 — Soul check:** Read for specific departures from the selected identity and
assignment. Name the passage and the identity evidence or assignment need it fails:
- Missing opinions or uncertainty that the author's source material expresses
- Missing first-person perspective when the assignment and identity call for it
- Lost humor or rhetorical devices present in the same-mode calibration passages
- Uniform energy where the source material establishes a change in stakes
- Promotional claims that obscure the concrete point the reader needs

This pass judges voice fidelity, not AI authorship. Apply the non-findings in the catalog's
"Running the check" preamble. Formality, blandness, correct grammar, or an absence of humor
alone warrants no rewrite. Report unresolved calibration instead of inventing a voice.
With a personal identity, restore evidenced devices, opinions, and attitude. With
corporate-only writing, use the generic tone and corporate identity without inventing a
named persona. Preserve neutral exposition when it serves the assignment.

Rewrite contextual findings whose stated test establishes a defect. Preserve justified
assignment rhetoric under the shared sweep-review procedure; record its disposition.

**Rewrite audit:** After rewriting any anti-pattern hit, re-read the replacement sentence
in isolation and check it against EVERY pattern. Rewrites frequently introduce the same
pattern in a different surface form. This is especially true for:
- #2 (Parallel Binary) — the most likely pattern to survive a rewrite, because describing
  a comparison naturally produces mirrored clauses. If you rewrote a parallel binary and the
  new version still has two clauses about two different things, check the grammatical
  skeleton. If both clauses have the same shape, you just wrote another parallel binary.
- #6 (Self-Answering Fragment) — rewrites often turn "The result? Great." into a longer
  question with a longer answer, but the structure is identical.

Review the replacement against the full catalog with its contextual boundaries. A new
match requires a disposition, not an automatic rewrite to remove its surface form.

**Voice calibration:** After resolving or documenting the contextual findings, apply
`skills/blog-writer/references/voice-calibration.md`. For personal identity, re-read the
selected evidence and compare the pre-edit and post-edit prose on narrator presence, spoken
cadence, connective flow, reader relationship, and argument movement. Documented devices
are evidence-backed options, not quotas. For corporate-only writing, mark personal voice
calibration not applicable and check human readability against the generic tone guide and
corporate identity instead.

**Proportionality check:** After all rewrites are done, compare the edited draft against
the pre-scan version and verify the author-preservation contract in
`skills/blog-writer/references/voice-calibration.md`. Record source and revision passages
for the protected functions; an assertion that the draft "still sounds like the author"
is not evidence. Repair lost functions before calling the draft ready. Then ask two
questions at the draft level:
- Is the amount of rewriting proportional to the actual slop found? If the scan flagged
  five sentences and forty changed, the editing pass over-reached. Correct established defects, not every stylistic resemblance or neighboring sentence.
- Would the author recognize this draft as their own voice? The scan's failure mode is
  laundering the voice out along with the patterns: every paragraph equally tidy, every
  edge sanded off, distinctive lines rewritten "for consistency." A voice device that
  merely resembles a pattern (the carve-outs in `ai-anti-patterns.md` list the known
  cases) stays. If the answer to this question is no, restore the human sentences the
  scan did not establish as defects, including justified retained stylistic hits.

Run the prose-level structural audits. Open `skills/blog-writer/references/structural-audits.md` and run audits
3, 4, and 5 **one at a time**, after the anti-pattern check is complete. Read the personal
voice resource first when selected: where it already prescribes the human-side behavior,
the audit is a drift check — "did this draft wander off the profile" — not a new rule.

- **Audit 3 — Emotion mode.** Pattern #39 catches the individual hits during Pass 1. This
  audit asks the document-level question: across the whole post, how many emotional beats
  are performed through the body and how many are named? A draft can dodge every #39 hit and
  still never once say what the author felt.
- **Audit 4 — Reference specificity.** Sweep for unnamed things: "a popular CI tool", "the
  team", "recently", "significant savings". Name each one. Where the specific isn't known,
  that is a `Fact` placeholder for the author, not a licence to stay vague — a vague allusion
  is a placeholder nobody flagged. Pattern #25 covers the "experts say" shape; this is
  broader.
- **Audit 5 — Reader engagement.** One moment per post that acknowledges the writing
  situation, or none. Check the personal voice resource, when selected, before adding any: a profile that already
  lists asides or direct address as devices satisfies this natively, and adding more doubles
  the dose.

Apply at most two interventions from the file's menu to any one post, and vary them across
posts. Uniform application of the whole menu is the convergence trap the file opens with —
it trades one detectable shape for another.

Run the paragraph continuity check from `skills/blog-writer/references/voice-calibration.md`
after the structural audits and each later editing pass. Check sentence order within
paragraphs as well as adjacent paragraph pairs; inspect longer runs when the artifact
contains them. Repair reorderable cards by restoring real
argument movement. Preserve a dependent punchline paragraph, an earned digression,
connective tissue, and related ideas that belong together.

Run the product accuracy check when a selected identity declares `product-context`. Verify
every claim about the product — feature names, CLI commands, behavior, and terminology —
against authoritative pages fetched in Phase 0. Fetch any newly needed page through the
routed product context. Do not guess. Flag contradictions and unsupported claims.

Run the tightening pass. Re-read the draft sentence by sentence with fresh eyes:
- For every sentence, ask: "would the reader miss this if it vanished?" If not, cut it.
- Identify redundancies — two sentences making the same point in different words. Keep the
  stronger one.
- Kill bloated transitions: "Now that we've seen X, let's look at Y" can almost always be
  replaced by just starting Y.
- Check for hedging filler that crept in: "basically," "essentially," "in order to."
- One data point per beat: if a paragraph has two statistics making the same point ("reduced
  from 45 minutes to 90 seconds, a 97% improvement, saving 6 hours per week"), pick the one
  that hits hardest and cut the rest. The extras are noise.
- Isolate the punchline: the final sentence of a key section should get its own line. If the
  punchline is buried in a paragraph, give it a line break so it lands with weight.
- Black marker test: mentally redact the product or tool name from every product-facing
  paragraph. If the paragraph could describe any competitor's product just as well, it's
  not specific enough. Add concrete details — specific features, real numbers, actual
  behavior — that only apply to this product.
- The goal is to tighten without losing substance. A post that's 1,700 words of meat is
  better than 2,000 words with padding.

Run `skills/blog-writer/references/fresh-reader.md` and resolve or disclose audience
comprehension findings before delivery.

**Checkpoint:** Write the first draft to `blog-draft-[slug].md` in the working directory.
Tell the author the file is ready for review. Also display a summary in conversation with
word count, placeholder counts by type, open questions, mechanical sweep state, manual
anti-pattern review state, author-preservation evidence, voice calibration state and
evidence, assignment mode, and
paragraph continuity state. Report each state independently.

## Phase 4: Revision

**Purpose:** Iterate based on author feedback. This phase loops until the author declares
the post done.

**If personal identity is selected, re-read its voice resource and selected calibration
passages now.** Every time you enter Phase 4 or return after author feedback, re-read them
and restate the assignment mode and calibration readiness. Long revision cycles are where
voice drift happens.

**Draft is a file.** All revisions happen in `blog-draft-[slug].md` using the Edit tool.
This gives the author a persistent artifact they can review in their editor, diff against
previous versions, and eventually copy to the CMS. Don't rewrite the entire draft in
conversation — edit the file surgically.

**What to expect:**
- Tone adjustments ("this section sounds too corporate")
- Technical corrections ("that's not how the API actually works")
- Structural changes ("move this section before that one")
- Cuts ("we don't need this paragraph")
- Additions ("add a section about X")
- Screenshot and code placeholder updates

**How to handle feedback:**
- Apply changes to the draft file using Edit
- Re-run the anti-pattern check (`skills/blog-writer/references/ai-anti-patterns.md`) after changes — all
  three passes (surface scan + skeleton scan + soul check) for new or rewritten sections.
  Apply the rewrite
  audit rule: check each replacement against the full catalog and record contextual
  dispositions before considering its defect fixed. Then run the applicable personal-identity or corporate-only voice
  check and redo any rewrite that's clean but flat. New writing can introduce new patterns
- Re-run the product accuracy check if any product feature descriptions, commands, or
  terminology were added or changed (only if product context is configured) — use
  WebFetch against docs pages as needed
- If a change conflicts with the tone guide, flag it but defer to the author
- When replacing placeholders with actual content, integrate smoothly — don't just drop
  in an image or code block without adjusting the surrounding prose
- Re-run the fresh Gemini audience review after substantive revisions; give the
  new call only the revised reader-visible material and audience prerequisites.
- Re-run the tightening pass on any new or rewritten sections — additions tend to
  introduce redundancy with existing content
- Re-run structural audits 3, 4, and 5 on new or rewritten sections. A section added in
  Phase 4 has been through no structural check at all
- Re-run voice calibration and paragraph continuity on new or rewritten prose. Compare the
  original assignment, pre-edit, and post-edit text, then report the preservation and
  review states from the voice-calibration reference independently

**The author decides when revision is done.** Their declaration starts the final artifact
gate. Run `sweep.py --mode final` through the invocation and exit-code contract in SKILL.md
Step 11 and `skills/blog-writer/references/sweep-review.md`. Final mode blocks every
supported asset placeholder, unresolved `VERIFY` marker,
and deterministic interface-residue hit. Resolve required hits and record contextual
dispositions under the shared procedure; retained stylistic hits remain reported. Review every emitted assistant-chatter candidate in context; remove assistant-to-author
residue and retain intentional reader-facing prose. Citation and link accuracy remain
findings from the product-accuracy and source-verification passes, not this presence check.

**Recording the post's shape** is Step 12 of the skill, not part of this phase. Once the
author declares the post done, that step runs the writer and owns the routing contract.
Do not record it here — invoking the writer from both places would file the post twice.
